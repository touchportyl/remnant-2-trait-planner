## Remnant 2 Trait Planner
The unofficial Remnant 2 trait planner. Use this to plan your trait point allocations!

### Developer's Notes
Coded entirely in one file with inline CSS and inline vanilla Javascript. The true dark souls of coding practices.

It's just a little side project for fun. Don't expect too much out of it.

All asset credits goes to Remnant 2. I only coded the website.
Remnant 2 Logo and trailer video is taken directly from the main Remnant website. All the trait images/icons are taken from the wiki.

### Updates
- As of patch 08.04.23: Trait cap increased to 65 (90 total)
